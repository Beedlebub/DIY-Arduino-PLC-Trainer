# Phase 3.0.4 – Minor Bug Fix + Enhanced Internal Comments

**Release Date:** 2024-04-30  
**Tag:** `v3.0.4`  
**Branch:** `phase3-dev`

---

## ✅ Summary of Changes

- 🐞 **Bug Fix**  
  Fixed a logic error where the system would print `"Fault button released early"` even during an actual transition to FAULT.  
  ✔ Resolved by placing a `return` statement immediately after changing state to FAULT, bypassing further fault button logic for that cycle.

- 💬 **Improved Code Comments**  
  Added detailed, beginner-friendly inline comments throughout the code:
  - System state explanations
  - LED and buzzer behavior
  - Button debounce and hold tracking
  - EEPROM behavior
  - State-specific transitions and logic breakdown

---

## 🔧 Behavior Overview (Unchanged but Documented)

- **Start/Stop Buttons (3-second hold)**
  - LED blinks yellow during hold
  - Green = running, Red = stopped
  - Console shows `"Start button released early"` if you let go too soon

- **Fault Button**
  - Immediate fault on press (3 red beeps)
  - FAULT state triggers motor OFF and fast red LED blink
  - Hold 5 seconds to clear (slow red blink while holding)
  - Console prints `"Fault button released early"` if canceled

---

## 🧪 Testing and Verification

- All tests passed:
  - Solid and blinking LED behavior
  - Early release feedback restored
  - EEPROM restores fault correctly after reset
  - Relay pin toggles properly
