It focuses primarily on documentation updates to fully reflect the current hardware wiring and system layout.

### âœ¨ Changes

- Updated `HARDWARE_OVERVIEW.md`:
  - Added 12V DC Motor entry to hardware requirements
  - Documented Relay Channel 4 (D12) controlling the motor
  - Specified Buck Converter supplying power via VIN/GND
  - Clarified NeoPixel and Piezo functions

- General documentation cleanup for better clarity and maintainability
- Confirmed Arduino Uno pin mappings are complete and accurate
