# ðŸš€ Phase 3.0.2 - Motor Relay Integration + Helper Functions Restored

## Summary
This update finalizes the Phase 3 starter foundation.  
It integrates hardware motor control through the relay board while preserving full LED and buzzer feedback from previous phases.  
This brings the system to the first "motor-ready" working state for the PLC Trainer.

---

## What's New
âœ… Added Motor Relay Control:
- Relay connected to pin 12 now toggles the motor ON/OFF based on the machine's state.
- Motor OFF in STOPPED state, ON in RUNNING state, OFF in FAULT state.

âœ… Restored All Core Helper Functions:
- `readButtons()`, `handleBlink()`, and other state helpers now fully organized again.
- Clear modular structure, ready for new expansions.

âœ… Solidified Button Debounce and Hold-Press Logic:
- Start = 3-second hold to RUNNING.
- Stop = 3-second hold to STOPPED.
- Fault Clear = 5-second hold while fault active.

âœ… Automatic Motor Safety on Startup:
- Motor will NOT run when the system is first powered up.
- Faults clear motor output correctly.

âœ… EEPROM Persistent Fault Recovery:
- Fault state survives power loss.
- Unit will reboot into FAULT if a fault was active at shutdown.

âœ… Piezo Buzzer Feedback:
- 1 Beep: Successful START.
- 2 Beeps: Successful STOP or FAULT clear.
- 3 Beeps: FAULT triggered.

## Codebase Improvements
- **BuzzerController** and **LedController** classes modularized in beginner-friendly form.
- **Pin naming** standardized for clarity: `startMotorButtonPin`, `stopMotorButtonPin`, `faultSimButtonPin`.
- **New Comment Headers** for all major functions for easier navigation.
- **Setup defaults** configured for clean startup and faster debug output.

---

## Known Status
âœ… Motor control tested and working
âœ… Buttons and buzzer fully operational
âœ… NeoPixel feedback solid for all states
âœ… Code compiles cleanly under PlatformIO
âœ… Project syncs cleanly with GitHub and labels
âœ… Fully matches Phase 3.0.2 branch in active development

---

## Next Planned Enhancements (future branches):
- Consolidate blinking logic for even cleaner state management.
- Introduce a **Button Class** to further modularize hold detection and debouncing.
- Migrate to 12V motor, relay, and logic power (Phase 4 planned).
- Add motor RPM monitoring (optional bonus feature).
