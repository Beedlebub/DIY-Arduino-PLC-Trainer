# ðŸ“¦ Release: v3.0.2 - Motor Control Integration (Phase 3)

### Summary
- Phase 3 brings the first integration of hardware output control: a motor relay is now tied directly to the RUNNING and OFF states.
- The motor no longer spins immediately at boot â€” correct relay logic is applied based on state transitions.

### Changes
âœ… Added `motorRelayPin` (D12) setup and management  
âœ… Turn ON motor relay when system transitions to RUNNING  
âœ… Turn OFF motor relay during OFF or FAULT transitions  
âœ… Re-synced all helper functions (readButtons, handleBlink, etc.) to working state  
âœ… Improved and cleaned up code comments for OpenPLC compatibility (future-proofing)  
âœ… Maintained full EEPROM fault recovery functionality

### Compatibility
- Designed for Arduino Uno
- Wiring layout and I/O mapping is compatible with OpenPLC standard pins
- No external libraries added beyond Adafruit NeoPixel
