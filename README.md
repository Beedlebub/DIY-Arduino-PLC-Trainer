# DIY PLC Trainer - Arduino Uno - Phase 3 (Motor Integration)

This project simulates a basic industrial Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) system using an Arduino Uno.  
It models machine states (Stopped, Running, Fault) and now **controls a real motor** through a relay.

## System Behavior

| State | LED Feedback | Buzzer Feedback | Motor Relay |
|:-----|:-------------|:----------------|:------------|
| Stopped (OFF) | Solid Red | 2 beeps (stop success) | OFF |
| Running | Solid Green | 1 beep (start success) | ON |
| Holding Start/Stop | Flashing Yellow | None during hold | (Depends) |
| Fault Active | Fast Flashing Red | 3 quick beeps | OFF |
| Fault Clearing | Slow Flashing Red | 2 beeps when cleared | OFF |

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Beedlebub/plcTrainer_Uno.git
    ```

2. Open project in **VSCode + PlatformIO**.

3. Verify `platformio.ini` settings:
    ```ini
    [env:uno]
    platform = atmelavr
    board = uno
    framework = arduino
    lib_deps = 
      adafruit/Adafruit NeoPixel@^1.12.5
    monitor_speed = 115200
    ```

4. Connect hardware as per wiring diagram.

5. Upload firmware:
    - Press PlatformIO "Upload" button or use `pio run --target upload`.

6. Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to watch debug output.

## Versioning

- `Phase 3.0.4`  
- Code includes helper classes, clean state management, and motor relay integration.
- Added return after transitioning to FAULT to avoid "released early" print.
- Improved early-release handling and comment clarity.


Future Roadmap:
- Add some analog sensors to the circuit: light and temp
- Port this functionality to OpenPLC
- Expand system to higher voltages (12V and eventually 24V).
