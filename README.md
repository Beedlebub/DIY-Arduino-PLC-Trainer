# PLC Trainer (Arduino Uno) (Currently @ Phase 2 Final)
ðŸ›  Built with PlatformIO
ðŸŽ¯ Target platform: Arduino Uno

Overview:
This project simulates a basic industrial motor controller using an Arduino Uno. It can be programmed in C++, but better yet, use OpenPLC!!

It uses:
- Physical buttons
- A NeoPixel LED
- A piezo buzzer
...to represent machine states: Stopped, Running, and Fault.

Button holds are required for confirmation â€” not just taps â€” to better simulate real-world machine control systems.


Features:
âœ… 3 Buttons for User Control:
- Start button â†’ Begin motor (after 3s hold)
- Stop button â†’ Stop motor (after 3s hold)
- Fault simulation button â†’ Trigger immediate FAULT

âœ… NeoPixel LED Visual Feedback:
- Solid Red â†’ Machine Stopped
- Solid Green â†’ Machine Running
- Flashing Yellow â†’ During Start/Stop hold
- Fast Flashing Red â†’ Active Fault
- Slow Flashing Red â†’ Fault Clear in Progress

âœ… Piezo Buzzer Audio Feedback:
- 1 beep â†’ Start successful
- 2 beeps â†’ Stop successful or Fault cleared
- 3 quick beeps â†’ Fault triggered or recovered on power-up

âœ… EEPROM Fault Recovery:
- Fault state is saved and restored after a power cycle.

âœ… Debounced, Non-blocking Button Handling:
- Millis()-based, no delay() blocking.

âœ… Modular Code Design:
- LedController class
- BuzzerController class

Quick Demo Instructions:
- Hold Start Button (D4) for 3 seconds â†’ Motor "starts" (Solid Green LED + 1 beep).
- Hold Stop Button (D3) for 3 seconds â†’ Motor "stops" (Solid Red LED + 2 beeps).
- Press Fault Button (D2) once â†’ Immediate Fault (Fast Red Flash + 3 quick beeps).
- Hold Fault Button (D2) for 5 seconds â†’ Clear Fault (Slow Red Flash during hold, 2 beeps after success).
